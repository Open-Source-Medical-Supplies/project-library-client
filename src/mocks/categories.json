          "additional_requirements": "Labeling of gowns: Per the FDA Enforcement Policy for Gowns, Other Apparel, and Gloves During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency there are labeling requirements (please review the guidance in its entirety). For example these requirements from Section C. Non-surgical Gowns and Minimal-to-Low Barrier Protection Surgical Apparel (additional information can be found in the link above): \n- The product includes labeling that accurately describes the product as a “gown,” or “toga,” or other apparel (as opposed to a “surgical gown,” or “surgical toga”) and includes a list of the body contacting materials (which does not include any drugs or biologics); \n- The product includes labeling that makes recommendations that would reduce sufficiently the risk of use, for example, recommendations against: use in a surgical setting or where significant exposure to liquid bodily or other hazardous fluids may be expected, use in a clinical setting where Level 3 or 4 protection is warranted, and use in the presence of high intensity heat source or flammable gas; and \n- The product is not intended for any use that would create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency, for example, the labeling does not include uses for antimicrobial or antiviral protection or related uses or uses for infection prevention or reduction or related uses.\n\nSewing: Sewing with household machines can be leveraged within most communities to make gowns for local medical facilities. It has the advantage of utilizing equipment and skill sets that are common. It has the disadvantage of being the most labor-intensive approach to gown production and is not suitable for some types of materials. This method is not recommended for single-use items because of the amount of work it takes to sew a gown. Further, repetitive gown production on a non-industrial sewing machine may lead to machine fatigue.\n\nIndustrial sewing: Sewing using industrial-grade equipment greatly increases production efficiency but requires specific tooling and pattern file types. This method has the potential to meet higher volume facility needs but may take time before it can be put into place. \n\nCNC router: Often paired with industrial sewing or other industrial production. Certain types of CNC routers can greatly increase cutting efficiency in gown production.  \n\nSeam bonding: Often used in conjunction with industrial production of gown materials. Seam bonding greatly increases the barrier protection a gown offers at the seams. Some nonwoven plastics cannot be sewn and must be seam sealed. \n\nSewing + Seam bonding: Washable woven gowns should be sewn and seam bonded if possible for the combined durability of sewn seams and the liquid barrier properties of seam bonding. \n\nUS Standards\nLiquid barrier protection is a key consideration for the effective use of gowns. The US ANSI/AAMI PB70 sets forth classifications and requirements for ranking liquid barrier protection in personal protective gowns.\n\nBrief Summary of FDA description of the ANSI/AAMI PB70 standard regarding gown protection levels\n\nThe ANSI/AAMI PB70 barrier protection standard is a broad standard that governs the protection level of the garment and guidelines for labeling requirements. A free copy of the standard can be obtained through the AAMI store [ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012]. \n\tSummary of the testing covered in the PB70\nLevel 1: AATCC 42 impact test (less than 4.5g gain)\nLevel 2: AATCC 42 impact test (less than 1g gain) and AATCC 127 Hydrostatic test (20 cm pressure\nLevel 3: AATCC 42 impact test and AATCC 127 Hydrostatic test (50 cm pressure)\nLevel 4: ASTM F1671 simulated blood and virus particle tests (a free copy can be found in their COVID reading room)\n\nAnalog Tests to the AATCC 42 and AATCC127\nIn an effort to support rapidly assessing estimated protection levels of various materials that a producer might have available for gown making analogs to the official tests have been developed by the Future Forge Makerspace. These tests have not been approved by any governing body, OSMS, or the Future Forge for defining protection levels and should only be used by producers and/or medical facilities when no official testing data is available and used at their own risk. The summary of the tests and test analogs can be found here. \n\nSelecting a Design and Material\nIt is highly recommended that makers/manufacturers work with medical facilities when selecting which designs and materials to use in the production of protective gowns. The selections will be dependent on what manufacturing techniques are available, which materials are available, and which designs will be accepted by facilities. \n\n\tSimplified Design and Material Selection Flowchart \n\nGown Material\nDue to the crisis PPE needs, many facilities turned to using Tyvek Housewrap for gown making as it was the only protective material available in bulk. Clinical feedback has determined that Tyvek Housewrap is unsuitable for a gown construction as it doesn’t drape well, makes noise, is bulky, and is difficult to wear. Furthermore, DuPont has recommended it not be used for PPE construction as it is not graded for that purpose. To learn more about Tyvek-related products and their PPE indications, click here. To find a DuPont distributor, follow this link. Research facility material choices before using House wrap for isolation gown construction.\n\nMaterials List\n\nDuPont 1222A\n- A new DuPont PPE grade fabric as of 4/21/2020.

However, recent studies [4][5] have been cited by the US-FDA as preliminary evidence that aerosol boxes may not provide the intended protection and may actually increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19.
